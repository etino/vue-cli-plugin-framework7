# vue-cli-plugin-framework7

Vue CLI 3 plugin for adding Framework7 support to project using framework7-vue.

(Project forked from: https://github.com/NataliaTepluhina/vue-cli-plugin-rx)

## How to Use

You need Vue CLI 3 installed globally as a pre-requisite. If you don't have it, please run

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Create a new Project

```
vue create project-name
```

Enter insiede the directory project and install vue-cli-plugin-framework7

```
cd project-name
```

To add Framework7 support to your vue-cli-powered project, run the following command in the project root folder:

```
vue add framework7
```

You will be prompted to choose if you want to add the Framewor7 example application. 

If you pick `yes` option, the example application will replace the example Vue App in your project (attention, the framework7 package is about 165MB).

Run

```
npm run serve 
```

and browse to http://localhost:8080/ to test your new Vue Framework7 Boilerplate project. :-)
